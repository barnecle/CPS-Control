##Build

To build the body of the Alphabot2-pi, the diagrams found in this slide pack:https://www.waveshare.com/w/upload/1/1a/Alphabot2-pi-assembly-diagram-en.pdf. The camera step was skipped and before attaching the top of the bot to the base, the SD card was uploaded with a Raspbian OS from the Raspberry Pi imager. The bootloader was also uploaded to the card, but eventually the card was reflashed and the bootloader was not loaded onto it again.
